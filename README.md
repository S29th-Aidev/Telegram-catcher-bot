This bot is completly made by google AI Studio. If you just like to create a bot this is for you
I don't know anything about coding I just liked to create a bot
I appricate any update or debug that anyone do on this. Thanks a lot

I would like to add a little descripton for anyone who don't know anything about coding but intreasted to create a bot like this:

1- Create a bot using @BotFather(https://telegram.me/BotFather) in telegram

2- Get you bot Token from bot father and replace it in line 18 "TOKEN = 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'"

3- Get your telegram numeric id. You can get it from @userinfobot (https://telegram.me/userinfobot) or any other way you know. Replace Your id in line 19 "OWNER_ID = YOUR_OWN_ID"

4- Create 2 database channels. You can call them anything you like. They can be both private or public but if you are going to upload anything +18 I recommend you to create the first and main database channel as a private channel.

5- Get your database channels numeric ids. You can get them by copying a message link from them. If they are private it's required but if they are not itsn't

6- Replace you channel ids in line 20 and 21. For private channels use this fromat: -100channel id --> For example if your channel id is 123456789 it will be -100123456789. For public channel ids just put their addres in this format "@channel_address" --> For example if your channel adress is Database_public it sould look like this "@Database_public". The "" and @ is required

7- If you don't have python first install it from https://www.python.org/downloads/ I'm not sure if there is any required package for the bot to run or not. If you run it and you get error ask Chatgpt how to fix it

8- Run the bot in the powershell. To do that hold shift and right click in the folder you have this .py file in then click on "Open PowerShell window here"

9- When PoweShell open write "python catcher_bot.py" If you are using another name type that name

If you did everything correctly you should see "Bot Running..." in the PowerShell. You can also check this with sending /start to the bot

Use /help in bot DM to see all bot commands (I also list them below)

Any character from Hentai rarity will be sent only into the "Main database" which is first database

Any change over character information will be applied on the corresponding message. The bot doesn't send new messages in database for every change

When a sudo delete a character the character information will be sent to the Owner DM so they can add them again if it was needed
